# Welcome to your AWS Design and Development Python project!

This is a `Design Day 8` Task .



Task to do for this Project is:

1) Application Design ONLY - Create a design for the following application:

As everyone has been experiencing, there has been an increase in the price of goods and services
whether it is because of unstable environmental factors or the state of the current economy. Design an
application that will collect and analyze usersâ€™ expenditure data (images of receipts taken from the
mobile camera, manually adding expense information ) to present users their personal consumption
structure, to manage their everyday finances so that users can deal with their budget and expenses to
save money. The application should be able to recognize words and prices from receipts, sort items

into specific categories, analyse and calculate the amount of each category at the end of a particular
period. The application should also:


```
(a) Remind users of excessed budget and provides expenditure summary
(b) Create a projection of monthly expenses that the users have
(c) Provide a goal for users so that they are motivated to manage their daily finances well.

```

### The AWS Resources will be used, listed as:

```
1) API GateWay
2) Lambda
3) Image Rekognition
4) DynamoDB
5) SNS
```
