# Welcome to your CDK Python project!

This is a `Design Day 3` Task .



Task to do for this Project is:
1) Application Design ONLY: Create a design for the following application:

```

The Australian property market has undergone “unprecedented growth” in the past two years due to the low-interest rates and strong consumer 
confidence (Thomas, 2022). This results in significant movements and transactions within the property market that will increase the digital 
traffic to real websites as more people sell, buy or rent properties. Design an application that allows the property owner and purchaser/tenant
to match based on factors detailed below. Property owner will upload their properties for sale or rent on the application. They should also be 
able to input their desired characteristics of buyers and tenants as criteria (e.g. family size, nationality etc). Purchaser or tenant
will then be able to browse for the property based on price, location, proximity to school and transport
station.

```





Happy Coding!!!
